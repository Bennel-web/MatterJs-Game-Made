Some of the externals scripts I used are not useful
in some files : For example for the buttonMachinsMechanics
the scripts : pathSeg.js,poly-decomp, matterWrap.js,attractors
and myCanvas.js are not useful but in
some other files ,they're useful.
These are realatives paths but you can 
download all these scripts on github apart
myCanvas.js wich is mine.
Search on github for all these scripts
